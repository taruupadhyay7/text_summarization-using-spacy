            "Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry, contributes significantly to India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n",
            "While the sector’s share in GDP has declined due to rapid growth in industry and services, agriculture continues to be the backbone of rural India.\n",
            "The Green Revolution in the 1960s marked a major turning point, bringing high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, improved irrigation systems, and increased use of fertilizers and pesticides.\n",
            "Recent reforms also aimed at liberalizing agricultural marketing by allowing farmers to sell produce outside traditional mandis.\n",
            "Precision farming, which involves using sensors, drones, and satellite imagery, helps farmers apply the right inputs at the right time.\n",
            "E-commerce platforms are helping farmers sell their produce directly to consumers, bypassing middlemen and increasing their income.\n",
            "Organic agriculture, zero-budget natural farming, and integrated pest management are being encouraged to reduce dependency on chemical inputs.\n",
            "Agriculture also plays a key role in India's export economy.\n",
            "Despite its progress, agriculture in India must undergo systemic reforms to be future-ready.\n",
            "By blending traditional knowledge with modern innovation, and by ensuring farmers have access to resources, technology, and fair markets, the sector can continue to feed the nation and power rural prosperity.\n"
